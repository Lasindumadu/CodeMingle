# TODO: Update Course Card Effects and Remove Box Top

## Steps to Complete

1. **Remove Box Top from Course Cards**
   - Edit `ListCourseComponent.js` to remove the `user-card-header` div containing the avatar icon.

2. **Update Course Card Effects to Match User Cards**
   - Edit `ListComponents.css` to apply user card-like styles to `.list-card` (course cards), including:
     - Change background to gradient similar to user cards.
     - Adjust hover effects for consistency (e.g., glass morphism, animations).
     - Ensure other elements align with user card styles.

3. **Test Changes**
   - Run the frontend application.
   - Verify course cards display without the top header and have effects matching user cards.
   - Check for layout issues or visual inconsistencies.
