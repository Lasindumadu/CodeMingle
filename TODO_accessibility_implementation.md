# Accessibility Features Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add "Reduce Motion & Animations" toggle in settings page
- [x] Add "High Contrast Mode" toggle in settings page
- [x] Implement reduced motion functionality using CSS variables
- [x] Implement high contrast mode using CSS classes
- [x] Persist settings in localStorage
- [x] Apply settings globally on theme change

## Technical Details
- SettingsContext.js manages state and applies classes/CSS variables
- SettingsComponent.js provides UI toggles with descriptions
- themes.css uses CSS variables for transition/animation durations
- High contrast styles defined in themes.css with .high-contrast class

## Testing
- Toggle "Reduce Motion & Animations" should disable all transitions and animations
- Toggle "High Contrast Mode" should apply high contrast colors (white text on black background, thicker borders)
- Settings persist across sessions
- Works in both light and dark themes
