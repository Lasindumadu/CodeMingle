# Quiz Card Enhancement TODO

## Overview
Enhance the visual design and information display of quiz listing cards in the frontend UI for better user engagement.

## Steps
- [x] Update ListQuizComponent.js to improve quiz card UI: add badges for time limit and question count, better layout, icons, and visual elements.
- [x] Update ListComponents.css to add styles for new UI elements (e.g., time badge, question count icon, enhanced card hover effects).
- [x] Ensure responsiveness and test on different screen sizes.
- [x] Optionally enhance QuizTakingComponent.js UI if needed for consistency.

## Notes
- Use existing data: timeLimitMinutes for time badge, questions.length for question count.
- Add visual enhancements: color-coded badges, icons (e.g., clock for time, book for questions).
- Focus on UI only, no backend changes.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
