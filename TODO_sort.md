# TODO: Standardize Sort Order Labels Across All List Components

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update ListCourseComponent.js to use "A-Z"/"Z-A" instead of "Ascending"/"Descending"
- [x] Update ListLessonComponent.js to use "A-Z"/"Z-A" instead of "Ascending"/"Descending"
- [x] Update ListQuizComponent.js to use "A-Z"/"Z-A" instead of "Ascending"/"Descending"
- [x] Update ListCommentComponent.js to use "A-Z"/"Z-A" instead of "Ascending"/"Descending"

## Components Already Using A-Z/Z-A
- [x] ListEnrollmentComponent.js (already had A-Z/Z-A)
- [x] ListUserComponent.js (already had A-Z/Z-A)

## Details
- All list components now consistently use "A-Z" and "Z-A" for sort order labels
- This provides a more user-friendly interface across the application
- Sort functionality remains unchanged, only the labels were updated
