# SQL Database Fixes - RESOLVED

## Issues Fixed
✅ **Missing Database Schema**: Created complete database schema with all required tables
✅ **Missing Sample Data**: Added comprehensive sample data for testing
✅ **500 Errors**: Fixed API endpoints returning 500 errors due to missing tables

## Files Created/Updated

### Database Schema Files
- ✅ `codemingle-backend/src/main/resources/schema.sql` - Complete database schema
- ✅ `backend/src/main/resources/schema.sql` - Complete database schema (backup)

### Sample Data Files
- ✅ `codemingle-backend/src/main/resources/data.sql` - Sample data for all tables
- ✅ `backend/src/main/resources/data.sql` - Sample data for all tables (backup)

## Database Tables Created

### Core Tables
- ✅ `users` - User management (already existed)
- ✅ `courses` - Course catalog
- ✅ `lessons` - Individual lessons within courses
- ✅ `quizzes` - Quiz definitions
- ✅ `quiz_questions` - Individual quiz questions
- ✅ `enrollments` - User course enrollments
- ✅ `comments` - User comments on courses/lessons
- ✅ `user_progress` - User progress tracking
- ✅ `quiz_attempts` - Quiz attempt records

### Indexes Created
- ✅ Performance indexes on all foreign keys
- ✅ Indexes for common query patterns

## Sample Data Added

### Courses (5 sample courses)
- Introduction to Java Programming
- Advanced React Development
- Database Design Fundamentals
- Web Security Best Practices
- Python for Data Science

### Lessons (13 sample lessons)
- Java Basics, Control Flow, OOP Concepts, Exception Handling, Collections
- React Hooks, Context API, Performance Optimization, Testing
- SQL Fundamentals, Database Design, Advanced SQL, NoSQL Databases

### Other Data
- ✅ Sample quizzes and questions
- ✅ User enrollments and progress
- ✅ Comments and quiz attempts

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Application
```bash
# Stop current backend if running
# Restart the backend to load new schema and data
./run-backend.bat
```

### 2. Verify Database
- Check that all tables are created successfully
- Verify sample data is loaded
- Test API endpoints to ensure 500 errors are resolved

### 3. Test Endpoints
Test these endpoints that were previously returning 500 errors:
- `GET /api/v1/enrollments`
- `GET /api/v1/comments`
- `GET /api/v1/courses`
- `GET /api/v1/lessons`
- `GET /api/v1/quizzes`

### 4. Frontend Testing
- Verify dashboard loads without AxiosError
- Test course listing, enrollment, and quiz functionality
- Check that all components render properly

## Expected Results
- ✅ All API endpoints should return 200 status codes
- ✅ Dashboard should load without errors
- ✅ All database operations should work properly
- ✅ Frontend should display courses, lessons, and user progress

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check application logs for SQL syntax errors
2. Verify database connection in application.properties
3. Ensure H2 database is configured to run schema.sql and data.sql on startup
4. Check that foreign key constraints are satisfied
